###利用Google Teachable Machine 进行自动代码生成和训练。
###采用直接录制的方式，先录制背景环境音（所处环境为宿舍的安静环境），随后分别录制几个持续两秒的拍手、敲桌子、金属碰撞的声音，Teachable Machine会自动拆分为1s的声音样本，作为训练数据。随后进行模型训练，并可以查看训练结果。
###Automatic code generation and training using Google Teachable Machine.
###Using direct recording, the background ambient sound is recorded first (the environment is the quiet environment of the dormitory), and then several sounds of clapping, knocking on the table, and metal collision lasting for two seconds are recorded respectively, and the Teachable Machine will be automatically split into 1s sound samples to be used as the training data. Subsequently, model training is carried out, and the training results can be viewed.
